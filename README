Question 1
Let's assume I've got my Scanner object setup as shown below.
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Example {

    public void getInput() {
        Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);

        // read user input (first and last name, then age)
        // TODO

        // print user input to the console
        System.out.println("Hello, " + name ". You're " + age + " years old.");
        s.close();
    }
}
Given the text printed to the console and the implied data types, which methods of the Scanner class should I use and how do I use them?
Correct Answer:
String name = s.nextLine();
int age = s.nextInt();
This is correct because the string is set equal to getString, this stores the user input and returns it as a string using s.nextInt().

Question 3
Consider the following method definition.
public int add(int x, int y) {
    return x + y;
}
Assuming I've created an object of the class in which this method is defined called test, how can I use this method to compute and 
store the sum of two integers?
Correct Answer
int sum = test.add(123, 456);
This is correct as it fulfills the requirements of the syntax and runs with no errors.

Question 4
Consider the following code snippet.
String str = "Hello, there. My name is Joseph. What's yours?";
char c = str.charAt(7);
What is the value of c after running this code?
Correct Answer:
't'
This is correct because 7 spaces from the beginning of the string is the letter "t".

Question 5
Consider the following requirements for a method I need to write.

Accepts a single parameter
If that parameter is a whole number, return the parameter unchanged.
If that parameter contains a fractional component, return the next largest whole number.
Here's my method definition.

public double mystery(double x) {

}
You Answered:
This can't be done with a single line of code. 
Correct!
return Math.ceil(x);
I accidentally clicked the other option when it only asked for a single line of code, so technically it was half right whereas it
should've been correct.

Question 6
I want to read in some information from the user (i.e., by having him or her type things on the keyboard). I know I need to use the 
Scanner class, but I'm not sure how to create an object of that class.

Here's what I have so far...

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Example {

    public void getInput() {

    }
}
Assuming I will only need to use the Scanner in the getInput method, how should I create an object from the Scanner class to use?
Correct Answer:
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

Question 8
Which of the following are valid access modifiers for methods in Java? Select all that apply.
Correct!
  protected 
Correct!
  default 
Correct!
  public 
Correct!
  private
 These answers are correct because they all are valid access modifiers for methods in Java.
 
 Question 9
Match the access modifier with its visibility.
Correct!
public - Visible by all classes.
private - Correct Answer visible only within the class in which it's defined
default - Correct Answer visible within the class in which it's defined, as well as by classes within the same package
protected - Correct Answer visible within the class in which it's defined, by classes within the same package, and by subclasses of the 
class in which it's defined

Question 10
Consider the following method definition.

public long multiply(int a, int b, int c) {

}
Modify the following method definition so that it accepts three integers in the form of parameters, computes their product, and prints 
it to the console. The method should not return a value.
Correct Answer:
public void multiply(int a, int b, int c) {
    System.out.println(a * b * c);
}
This is correct because it accepts the 3 integers and does not need to return anything. The other answers are wrong because the method 
either isn’t void, meaning that it must return a value, or doesn’t print out the answer.

Question 11
Consider the following lines of code,

String s = "abcdefg";
String sub1 = s.substring(s.indexOf("c"));
String sub2 = s.substring(s.indexOf("e"), s.indexOf("g"));
What are the values of sub1 and sub2 after running this code?
Correct Answer:
cdefg and ef
This is correct because once the code has been run it breaks down the string and produces the results shown.

Question 13
When writing a method, you must always include a(n) static identifier , a(n) class definition symbol , and the method name (in that 
order). Together, this is known as the method's method identifier .
Correct Answer
access modifier
return type
method signature
These are correct because becuase the other options don't exist.

Question 14
I want to print each character of a String one-by-one on a separate line. The number of characters in the String is unknown. You may 
assume the String is stored in a variable called str. How can I do this? Select all that apply.
Correct!
for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {
    System.out.println(str.charAt(i));
}
This is the only correct answer as it is the only string of code that is sufficient for the problem at hand.

Question 15
Consider the following method definition.

public double randomNumber(int seed) {
    if (seed > 1000) {
        return Math.random() * seed;
    } else if (seed > 500) { 
        return Math.random() * seed * -1;
    }
}
I keep getting an error message telling me that my method must return a value of type double. What's wrong with my code?
This question didn't display any correct answer on Canvas. I assume the answer is 
For seed values less than or equal to 500, the method does not return a value.
